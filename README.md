# DynamicCard

DynamicCard is an Angular 18 project designed to dynamically create and display components based on an array of inputs. The components are generated and styled according to the properties defined in the input array, allowing for flexible and dynamic user interfaces.

## Features

- Dynamically generate components based on input data.
- Customize the style and layout of components via an array configuration.
- Supports multiple component types and layouts within the same interface.

## Development Server

Run `ng serve` to start a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you make changes to any source files.

## Code Scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Unit Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running End-to-End Tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
